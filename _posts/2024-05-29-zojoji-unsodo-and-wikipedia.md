Every now and again I like to purchase myself Japanese woodblock prints, or ukiyo-e. This is my first post about these purchases - who knows if more will come. This particular purchase was a christmas gift to myself, and I think it reflects my favourite season well.

I found this print while adventuring to *Yokimono Japanese Christmas Market* in early December of 2023. I'd seen the advert for the market on a flyer and was too tempted by the combination of an untravelled area of London and a Japanese market not to attend. I didn't know what would be at the festival, but it was a pleasant surprise in every way.

One of the pop-up shops of note was that of The Japanese Gallery, Angel. I'd known of them for a while, but never gone to their shop, despite living reasonably to it. Despite this, I took the plunge at this event and was rewarded with lots of beautiful prints to browse, and pleasant conversations with the staff. I had no real intention of splashing any cash upon entry, but was subdued by the gorgeous, saturated, winter prints and the passion of the staff.

This particular print was the one which really caught my eye, probably due to the snowy setting; incredibly saturdate reds; and calm atmosphere. I knew that it could not be an original printing due to the price being only ~Â£140 - the quality was as if it were printed the day before I arrived. No, this had to be a reproduction of some kind.

I enquired to one of the staff at the pop-up about the publisher, as a quick search online came up with nothing. That is when I first heard about *Unsodo*. I couldn't quite catch the name at the time, but it was explained to me that this print was produced from the original carvers and blocks that the original imprints made from. They described the publisher as well trusted, and as authentic as a reprint can get. I thanked them for the information and said I'd take some time to walk around the rest of the market while I ponder whether to purchase the print.

While combatting my financial concerns (just because the print is cheap for it's quality, doesn't mean it's cheap for me!), I was also furiously searching on my phone for any information I could find about this publishing company. I was confused why I could barely find anything if they were just a trusted and long-standing publishing house.

Regardless, upon my return to the pop-up shop, I was fed the information that this was the last of this print in their stock, and I finally gave in to purchasing it. While I was at it, I got a cheaper, smaller print too.

# Uncovering Unsodo
Upon aquiring a new print, I take extreme joy in doing everything I can to track down every detail about the item. This time was no exception, however, my focus was unusually dominated by the publishing house, rather than the print itself. Indeed, the print is relatively well-known, and it was not hard to find details on the artist, series, etc.
